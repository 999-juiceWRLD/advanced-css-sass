# Trillio Project

As `Natours`, it is a React app and, hence I try to improvise and do as much as I can by myself, it is not 100% same as the course's.

This part is tutorial of flexbox, (although that I know as grid and used it in `Natours`, I want to build another page) so it's going to be flex-oriented.

This time, I followed the same sass folder method.
